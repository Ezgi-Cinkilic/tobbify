Our project aims to create a music database management system that enhances the way
users organize and interact with music collections. The database will serve as a centralized
platform for storing and managing music-related data such as songs, albums, artists, and
playlists. It will target both casual users and professionals in the music industry, offering a
streamlined solution for cataloging and accessing large music libraries.
The system will allow users to search for tracks, manage playlists, and view detailed
information about albums and artists. This improves the accessibility and organization of
music collections, which is vital for artists, producers, and curators managing vast amounts of
data. The platform will provide advanced features like full-text search, music file storage and
playlist management ensuring users can easily retrieve and update information. Additionally,
a music recommendation system will be implemented on the homepage, using song labels
and playback history to generate suggestions.
Built with PostgreSQL for the database, Python for the backend logic, and Streamlit for the
user interface, the system will efficiently handle metadata. This architecture ensures
scalability, performance, and user-friendliness, offering a comprehensive solution for music
data management that caters to diverse user needs.
